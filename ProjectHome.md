## What's this about? ##
gpdroid started in [GP32spain](http://www.gp32spain.com). It's an Android OS port for GP2X / GP2X Wiz.

At this momment, it's in a very early alpha state.

In the downloads section, you can get userdata, ramdisk and system images.

Now i'm making a new u-boot, to launch them. I'll upload there too when it's ready.

Enjoy!
